Hello! Thank you for using Pepper's Ghost Pyramid.

To use this program, you must download OpenCV 3.4.0.
Go to https://opencv.org/releases.html and install it to C:\opencv.

Then add the OpenCV Java library to the project using an IDE of your choice.

When you start the program, there will be no output, nor input.
You must select a mode, then press start.

PLEASE ONLY PRESS START ONCE. DOING SO MORE TIMES WILL CRASH THE PROGRAM.

After pressing start, you may freely switch between the modes by selecting them,
without having to press start again.
